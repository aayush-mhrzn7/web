### About Me
I come from the vibrant city of Kathmandu, Nepal, where I've been fortunate enough to immerse myself in diverse cultures and experiences. From a young age, I've harbored a fascination for languages and technology, marveling at how they intersect to bridge gaps and foster communication across borders.
